# SpaceFighter-X

A simple space shooter game made using python. As the player, you are in charge of your spaceship! The ship or character follows mouse motion, mimicking your mouse position and allowing the player to dodge enemy ships and attacks while maintaining the fire intricately. At the menu screen, players can set the difficulty from ‘easy,' ‘medium,' or ‘hard.' You can also access the instructions from the menu screen. As the game progresses, the game’s difficulty is automatically adjusted based on player progression and score. Meaning, the longer you stay alive, the more difficult the game gets! As the pressure rises, the enemy ships will change in color to display the change in difficulty from the natural green, to slightly challenging yellow, to intense red. The health of the enemy ships also increases along with progression, making the game even more intriguing. Displayed at the top right corner, is the player’s health as hearts, 7 hearts in easy, 5 in medium, and 3 in hard. Recorded under the hearts is the player's score. When players reach 10000 scores, the boss appears. Players will also be able to pause the game whenever, by pressing the escape key. The pause menu also offers players to jump back to the menu screen or just exit the game.
